            <h2>Introduction to Google Interviews</h2>
            <p>Google is known for its challenging interviews, which test both your technical and behavioral skills. The interview process typically includes multiple rounds, including coding interviews, system design, and a behavioral interview. Here is a breakdown of the types of questions you may encounter during your Google interview:</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Technical Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>Google's technical interviews usually involve coding problems that test your problem-solving abilities, knowledge of algorithms, and data structures. Expect questions that challenge your logical thinking and ability to write clean and efficient code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps, etc.</li>
                <li>Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Recursion, etc.</li>
                <li>System Design: Large-scale system design and architectural questions.</li>
                <li>Concurrency: Multi-threading, deadlocks, synchronization, etc.</li>
                <li>Other topics: Bit Manipulation, Math Problems, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Find the longest substring without repeating characters."</span></p>
            <p class="tips">Tip: Focus on writing clean code and explaining your thought process during the interview. Use the whiteboard or coding platform to walk through your solution step by step.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Behavioral Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>In the behavioral interview, Google assesses how well you fit with their culture and values. You will be asked questions about your past experiences and how you handle various situations in the workplace. The goal is to evaluate your problem-solving skills, leadership qualities, and teamwork abilities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tell me about a time you faced a challenge at work and how you handled it.</li>
                <li>Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult colleague.</li>
                <li>Have you ever taken a risk at work? What was the outcome?</li>
                <li>How do you prioritize your tasks when faced with multiple deadlines?</li>
                <li>Tell me about a project you led and the results you achieved.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Tell me about a time you failed and how you handled it."</span></p>
            <p class="tips">Tip: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers. Be honest and focus on what you learned from the experience.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>System Design Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>System design interviews test your ability to design large-scale systems and applications. You will be asked to think through the architecture and design of complex systems, considering scalability, reliability, and performance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design a URL shortening service (e.g., Bit.ly).</li>
                <li>Design a social media platform with millions of users.</li>
                <li>Design a cache system for a web application.</li>
                <li>Design a messaging system for real-time communication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Design a global search engine."</span></p>
            <p class="tips">Tip: Start by gathering requirements and asking clarifying questions. Break the problem into smaller components and discuss trade-offs for each part of the system.</p>
