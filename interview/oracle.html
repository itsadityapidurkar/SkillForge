            <h2>Introduction to Oracle Interviews</h2>
            <p>Oracle's interview process is known for being challenging, and candidates can expect to face multiple rounds of interviews that assess both technical and behavioral skills. Oracle is a leader in database and enterprise software, and the interview process is designed to test your technical acumen, problem-solving ability, and cultural fit within the organization.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Technical Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>Oracle's technical interviews typically focus on data structures, algorithms, databases, and problem-solving. You will be asked coding problems to assess your ability to think critically and solve complex problems. Expect to be tested on your knowledge of programming languages, as well as your ability to write efficient and scalable code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps, etc.</li>
                <li>Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Greedy Algorithms, etc.</li>
                <li>Database Questions: SQL queries, Normalization, Transactions, Indexing, Database Design, etc.</li>
                <li>Operating Systems: Threads, Memory Management, File Systems, etc.</li>
                <li>System Design: Design large-scale applications and systems, considering scalability, performance, and reliability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Write an SQL query to find the second highest salary in an Employee table."</span></p>
            <p class="tips">Tip: Focus on your problem-solving approach and articulate your reasoning clearly. For SQL questions, practice writing optimized queries and understand the various joins, aggregations, and database operations.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Behavioral Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>The behavioral interview at Oracle focuses on understanding your past experiences, leadership qualities, and ability to work effectively in teams. Oracle values candidates who are self-motivated, collaborative, and can solve problems creatively.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tell me about a time you had to resolve a conflict within a team.</li>
                <li>Describe a project you worked on that required collaboration across multiple teams.</li>
                <li>Tell me about a time you had to learn a new technology or skill quickly to complete a task.</li>
                <li>Describe a time when you had to deal with a difficult situation or failure and how you overcame it.</li>
                <li>What motivates you to work at Oracle?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Tell me about a time you had to work under pressure to meet a deadline."</span></p>
            <p class="tips">Tip: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to answer behavioral questions. Emphasize the outcomes of your actions and the skills you applied to achieve results.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>System Design Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>Oracle's system design interviews test your ability to design large-scale, distributed systems that can handle millions of users. You will be asked to consider aspects such as system performance, scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design a URL shortening service (e.g., Bit.ly).</li>
                <li>Design a distributed caching system (e.g., Redis, Memcached).</li>
                <li>Design a recommendation system (e.g., for products or movies).</li>
                <li>Design a real-time messaging application (e.g., WhatsApp).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Design a real-time collaborative document editing system like Google Docs."</span></p>
            <p class="tips">Tip: Start by gathering requirements and asking clarifying questions. Break the system down into components, such as front-end, back-end, and database, and discuss how each part should scale and handle millions of users.</p>
