            <h2>Introduction to Microsoft Interviews</h2>
            <p>Microsoft is known for its rigorous interview process, which tests both technical and behavioral skills. The interview typically includes multiple rounds, including coding interviews, system design, and behavioral interviews. Here is a breakdown of the types of questions you may encounter during your Microsoft interview:</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Technical Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>Microsoft's technical interviews often focus on your problem-solving skills, coding ability, and understanding of algorithms and data structures. Expect to be asked coding questions that challenge your ability to write efficient and clean code, as well as conceptual questions about computer science fundamentals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps, etc.</li>
                <li>Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Recursion, etc.</li>
                <li>System Design: Designing scalable systems, architectural design, and performance optimization.</li>
                <li>Concurrency: Multi-threading, synchronization, and deadlocks.</li>
                <li>Other Topics: Bit Manipulation, String Manipulation, Mathematical Problems, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Given a list of numbers, find the two numbers that add up to a target sum."</span></p>
            <p class="tips">Tip: Practice solving problems on platforms like <span class="highlight">LeetCode</span>, <span class="highlight">HackerRank</span>, and <span class="highlight">CodeSignal</span>. Focus on writing clean and efficient code.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Behavioral Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>The behavioral interview at Microsoft assesses how well you fit with their company culture and how you approach problem-solving and teamwork. You will be asked to provide examples of your past experiences and how youâ€™ve handled different situations in the workplace.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tell me about a time when you faced a challenge at work and how you overcame it.</li>
                <li>Describe a situation where you worked in a team to achieve a common goal.</li>
                <li>Have you ever had a disagreement with a colleague? How did you resolve it?</li>
                <li>Tell me about a time when you had to learn something quickly in order to complete a project.</li>
                <li>What motivates you to do your best work?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Tell me about a time when you failed and how you dealt with it."</span></p>
            <p class="tips">Tip: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your responses. Be honest and focus on what you learned from the experience.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>System Design Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>System design interviews test your ability to design large-scale, distributed systems. You'll be asked to design systems that can handle millions of users, ensuring they are scalable, reliable, and efficient.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design a URL shortening service like Bit.ly.</li>
                <li>Design a cloud storage system (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).</li>
                <li>Design a messaging system for real-time communication (e.g., WhatsApp).</li>
                <li>Design a content delivery network (CDN).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Design a video streaming platform like YouTube."</span></p>
            <p class="tips">Tip: Start by asking clarifying questions to understand the scope. Break down the system into smaller components and discuss trade-offs and considerations for each part (e.g., databases, load balancing, caching).</p>
        </section>
